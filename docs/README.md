- Developed class for exporting geographic data from Qt framework to GeoJSON (RFC7946).
- Contributed the development of the framework, that include: detailed user documentation, examples and autotests (available since Qt 5.13).
- Built Qt application for use cases and debugging purpose.
- [List of publications](https://codereview.qt-project.org/q/owner:%22Julian+Sherollari%22+)

<br />

**Software Engineer** (-- The Qt Company Ltd, Oslo, Norway)<span class="right">2018.04 - 2018.08</span>

- Job performed inside the Google Summer of Code 2018 program.
- Designed and developed the feature-parity between the QtLocation module and the GeoJSON standard.
- Added GeoJSON interoperability to Qt framework by developing a paresr for QtPositioning API.
- Team working using the collaboration and revision tools (CI/CD).
- Reviewed by the community and submitted **(Git, Gerrit Code Review, Documentation Review)**.

## Projects

**Kalman Filter and Deep Learning Algorithms for SoC Estimation**<span class="role"></span> <span class="right">2019.03 - 2019.07</span><br>

- This project focused on assessment of three methods State Of Charge (SOC) estimation for Lithium-Ion battery in terms of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Open-Circuit Voltage (OCV) **(Matlab/Simulink, LaTex, Microsoft Office)**.

<br />

**Computational complexity in Algorithms for Solving Linear Systems**<span class="role"></span><span class="right">2018.03 - 2018.07</span><br>

- The project aimed to develop and analyze the main algorithms for solving system of linear equations. In particular was focused in Gauss–Seidel, Jacobi (iterative methods) and Gauss Elimination (direct method) **(C++, Linux, LaTex)**.
